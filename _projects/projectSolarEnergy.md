### It's purpose is forecasting electric energy generation by photovoltaic panels.

Collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/gerryatsxf/disponibilidad-recurso-energetico) that contain the reasoning and observations of the physical model used to estimate the available energy resource in solar radiation. The repository provides a thorough analysis of solar power generation with an emphasis on calculating the available solar energy resource based on provided solar irradiance data.

The physical model used in the analysis is a generalized projection model that projects the solar irradiance onto a generalized plane. The available solar energy resource is then calculated by translating the projected irradiance into available energy per square meter. The aim is to understand how the geometric variables of the physical system affect the available energy resource for a particular solar panel installation.

An interesting feature of the analysis is the comparison of projected irradiance for different angles of inclination on the same date. The comparison highlights the relevance of selecting the optimal angle of inclination for the solar panel installation to maximize energy production. 

In addition to studying the effects of different angles of inclination on the projected irradiance, we can also analyze how this irradiance varies over time for a fixed angle. By comparing the projected irradiance for two different dates, we can understand how the geometry of the Earth's orbit and its orientation with respect to the sun affects the amount of irradiance received.

This analysis shows that even a fixed-angle solar panel will experience seasonal variations in its projected irradiance due to the Earth's orbit and orientation. Understanding these variations can help us choose the optimal angle for a fixed panel or adjust the angle of an adjustable panel to maximize energy production throughout the year.

Overall, studying the projected irradiance of a solar panel from different angles and over different timescales is crucial for optimizing its performance and maximizing energy production. With the right tools and data, we can make informed decisions about the design and placement of solar panels to take full advantage of the power of the sun.
